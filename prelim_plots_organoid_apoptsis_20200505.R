# Apoptosis data from timelapse green fluorescent imaging of brain organoids,
# ~20 hours (5 minute time steps) after transfer to matrigel.

# Experiment design:
# 3 genotypes - WT (WTC11), KMT2D null (KMT2D5.6), KMT2D null (KMT2D10.1)
# null lines were separately derived, but using the same CRISPR guide rna.
